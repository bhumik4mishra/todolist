Simple To-Do List App using Vanilla JavaScript

This is a basic to-do list built with HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript.

Features:

Add new tasks by typing into the input box and clicking “Add tasks”.

Each task appears as a <li> with its own “Delete” button.

Clicking a “Delete” button removes that specific task from the list.

Uses event delegation so delete works for both existing and newly added tasks.
